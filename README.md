# Seattle vs St.Louis Weather

Description :
The purpose of this project is to determine the differences between St. Louis & Seattle Weather; specifically identifiying the differences in rain/precipitation. 

Data: 
The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information provides access to many types of environmental data, including records of daily precipitation. You can use their website https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND to request records of daily precipitation from Seattle and St. Louis (or other locations of interest) for the last 5 years (2018 - 2022). Dr. Brian Fischer, a professor at Seattle University, had both sets for seattle & st. louis ready for his students found in his git https://github.com/brian-fischer/DATA-3320/tree/main/weather

In order to prepare the data, specific steps were taken, this included: converting data types, selecting relevant subsets, removing unnecessary parts, identifying and dealing with NaN/missing values, mergining the two sets, renaming the columns and creating derived variables to use in the final analysis. 

The data preparation was done on google collabration & is called = Bayan_Farag_DATA_3320_Seattle_St.Louis_Data

The final data file is called = clean_seattle_stl_weather.csv
